# Reading Buses API
Since I orignally realsed this program there has been the launch of Reading Buses very own API. This API is signifcantly better then the old Reading Open Data API. You can get your own account from here:

I would strongly recommend migrating to this new API.


# Reading Open Data API (OLD Method)
A small little program testing out the Reading open data API to track the bus times in Reading. To use the code, you will first have to create your own Reading Open Data account at the following website:

http://opendata.reading-travelinfo.co.uk

Once you have created your own account, amend the API key to your own personal API key. This program makes uses of the "Bus Services", "Bus Arrival / Departures" and "Bus Routes" API specifically so ensure that you have subscribed to them. As per the license agreement set, you are free to use the code as you wish so long as any program using this code is under the same license and that your source code is also public.
