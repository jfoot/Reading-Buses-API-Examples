# Reading Buses API (Using my Library)
The latest program added to these examples uses my new Reading Buses API Library I made. The library is available via the Nuget store here: 
https://www.nuget.org/packages/ReadingBusesAPI/

The Library provides access to the following APIs: 
The library supports the List of Bus Stops, Live Vehicle Positions, Live Journey Details, Stop Predictions, List of Lines, Line Patterns, Timetabled Journeys, Tracking History and the Vehicle Position History API.

The example program shows selecting a service and then selecting a stop along this services route to get live departure information about this service at its stop.

# Legacy 
The old Reading Buses API (http://rtl2.ods-live.co.uk/cms/apiservice) has been switched off, these examples have been removed. Likewsie the Reading Open Data API (http://opendata.reading-travelinfo.co.uk) seems to have also stopped working sometime 2022. As such, this example has also been removed from the repository.
